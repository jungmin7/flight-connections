Our team has submitted the project goals and committed the team contract individually this week.
We have roughly set what datasets we will be using for the project. We are interested in using a BFS Traversal, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm. However, this could be changed as we are working on it.
Our team has also set the group work guidelines in the contract including the time commitment and work distribution.
This will be helpful for us in splitting tasks and efficiently working on the project.



Week of 11/30/20 

This week we had a mid-project check in meeting with our mentor, Zijie Lu. We only created class files and make files, so we were only able to dicuss about the kinds of algorithms we were interested in implementing. Additionally, during the meeting we asked important questions such as how to create test cases and structure our code. In the next few days after that meeting, we finished creating code that pulls data from the flight data sets. One data set we parsed is a data set that includes a list of all the airports and its respective longitude/latitude points; the other data set we parsed was one that details flight paths from one airport to another (for ex: SIN --> ICN). As an overview of our graph structure, using the longitude/latitude data from the airports, we calculated the distance between two airports using Haversine's distance formula. With this, the nodes represented airports, the directed edges represented flight paths between airports, and the edge weights represented the distance. In the next week, we will be working on creating test cases and implementing the algorithms.
