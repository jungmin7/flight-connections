Our team has submitted the project goals and committed the team contract individually this week.
We have roughly set what datasets we will be using for the project. We are interested in using a BFS Traversal, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm. However, this could be changed as we are working on it.
Our team has also set the group work guidelines in the contract including the time commitment and work distribution.
This will be helpful for us in splitting tasks and efficiently working on the project.
